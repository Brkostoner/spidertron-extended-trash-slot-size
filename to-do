 - add a logistics tab (devs confirmed planning to add a logistics tab in the future)
 - TBD: consider adding a weaponless Spidertron with a large inventory for use in construction
 - TBD: consider adding an early game Spidertron with limited functionality (maybe between car and tank tech ?) that requires fuel to move > similar to insectitron // to be honest i would like to add one after the car with guns and another one after the tank with cannons both with cycle on for maximum firing output
 - increase the individual size of Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3 (50% done)
 - increase stride distance for maximum stickbugness (added for next release)
 - add impalement/damage on contact with enemies
 - LOW PRIORITY - fix Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3 item icon iconsistencies if used as map pins 
 - REFACTORING
 
 - DONE: increase rocket launcher maximum range for Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3
 - DONE: changed Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3 base color on placement so they look different from the vanilla one
