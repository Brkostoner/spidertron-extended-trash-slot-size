 - add a logistics tab (devs confirmed planning to add a logistics tab in the future)
 - TBD: consider adding an early game Spidertron with limited functionality (maybe between car and tank tech ?) that requires fuel to move > similar to insectitron // to be honest i would like to add one after the car with guns and another one after the tank with cannons both with cycle on for maximum firing output
 - TBD: overall balancing
 - add impalement/damage on contact with enemies
 - LOW PRIORITY - fix Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3 item icon iconsistencies if used as map pins 
 - REFACTORING (50% done, i think)
 - flamethrower quad legged > very small size 0.5 or .4 the normal size, faster, 4 legs with a flamethrower, rocket launcher and a gun without auto cyclying
 - shield or tanky / paladin spidertron = skill to shield over or keep health in a point as active skill, passive skill to not die for 5 seconds when going under 10% hp.
 - turret spidertron, can deploy temporary turrets // like up to 3 turrets dissapears after like 30 seconds, if new one is placed destroy the first one? as active, as passive turret regen, or power for lazer turrets
