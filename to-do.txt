 - add impalement/damage on contact with enemies
 - LOW PRIORITY - fix Spidertron MK2 and Spidertron MK3 item icon iconsistencies if used as map pins 
 - REFACTORING (50% done, i think)
 - flamethrower quad legged > very small size 0.5 or .4 the normal size, faster, 4 legs with a flamethrower, rocket launcher and a gun without auto cyclying
 - add self-repair to Spidertron MK3
